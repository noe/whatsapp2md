# whatsapp2md

Parses whatsapp chat exports and generates a document.

```
Note: the format of the exported chats has been changing since I wrote this
project, and currently it may not work with some versions.
```


You can export a whatsapp chat by means of option
_More â†’ Export Chat_ in the chat's menu, and choose
to send it by email to yourself (including images).

This gives you a text file with the messages in the
chat plus a number of image files (whatsapp2md does
not support other type of documents).

This simple python script can take the whatsapp chat
export and generate a markdown file (.md) with
the contents of the chat.

You can then use your favourite markdown viewer to
print the it to PDF to get a self-contained document
that you can archive or share.

You can find an example of a generated markdown printed to pdf
[here](https://github.com/noe/whatsapp2md/raw/example/examples/superconf.pdf).

# FAQ

### Why my markdown file does not show my images?

`whatsapp2md` assumes your image files are in the same
directory as the markdown file. Probably your .md file
is in a different folder than the images.

### My chat text file is not properly parsed, what to do?

Whatsapp chat exports use different formats for
dates and times depending on your phone configuration.
Most probably `whatsapp2md` does not support your
configuration. Open an issue with an example chat export
text file along with information about which language
your phone is configured in. We will try to support it.
